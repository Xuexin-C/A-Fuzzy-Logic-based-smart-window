# A-Fuzzy-Logic-based-smart-window
This project is to design a fuzzy controller to control the transparency of Electrochromic glass to achieve the automatic adjustment of indoor illuminance and temperature.
The FLC is about the fuzzy logic controller of the smart window.
After running the file 'Visualization of FLC Membership Function', it will show five membership function diagrams of the FLC
The 'Visualization of FLC output' simulates the process of visible transmittance varying with indoor temperature and outdoor temperature under the control of the fuzzy controller and provides two visualized graphs.
